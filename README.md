In this project, I will analyze and visualize ride-sharing data using Python, Pandas, and the Matplotlib library.

### analysis1 insights/findings:

* Over 60% of all rides and total fare value come from urban riders.
* Rural riders tend to take significantly higher cost, albeit fewer, trips than urban or suburban riders.
* While comprising about 35% of all rides and fares, suburban and rural cities afford only 22% of Pyber's total driver population. There may be a strategic opportunity here to boost driver counts in these regions to enhance market share.
